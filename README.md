Work in progress!

The schematic is "done" and complete as far as we can tell.

The PCB needs much tracework for clearance violations and some BOM changes (pin spacing for the caps, they're "too big" compared to the original ones, but the board is already traced out for them, so... /shrug

The PCB is intended to be a reasonable "clone" of the original IBM board - large as it is. The intent is to be able to produce a look-alike board to be able to compare to an original board to validate the schematic and then to create a smaller board using more modern components as an affordable option to replace missing boards.

Any and all assistance is encouraged and welcomed. :-)

Thank you!
